## Symbolise layers by attributes

Before we actually make our map, let's equip ourselves with some extra skills for symbolising layers

So far we've ignored information in the attributes table of vector layers, and used identical symbology for all features in a layer.  Now it's time to explore a powerful visualisation option in QGIS :muscle: - the ability to **symbolise features by attributes**.  For vector layers, symbols are drawn according to properties (columns) in their attributes table.  For raster layers, symbols depend on the value within each grid cell

:information_source: For all of these instructions you need to have the `Layer Properties` window open on the `Symbology` tab

:warning: Be aware that the layers in the screenshots below are different from those in our gibbon case study

### Visualise *categorical* attributes

For **vector** layers :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

> 2. Select `Categorized` from the dropdown menu at the top (the default is `Single Symbol`)
1. Choose the column you want to symbolise from the `Value` dropdown menu; for example *ThreatType* from the *ThreatEvidence* layer
2. Click on the `Classify` button in the bottom left
3. Click `Apply` and `OK` to finish

For *thematic* **raster** layers :black_square_button:

> 1. Ensure `Render type` is *Paletted/Unique values*
1. Double click on the `Color` or `Label` to manually edit the colour or label of each pixel value in your 

### Visualise *continuous* attributes

For **vector** layers :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

> 1. Select `Graduated` from the dropdown menu at the top
1. Choose the column you want to symbolise from the `Value` dropdown menu; for example *GroupSize* in one of the *GibbonSightings* layers 
2. Click on the `Classify` button in the bottom left
3. Click `Apply` and `OK` to finish

For *continuous* **raster** layers :black_square_button:

We don't have an example of a continuous raster layer in the gibbon case study, but a DEM would be one example.  These instructions are included for completeness, to help those working with their own data 

> 1. Under `Render Type`, select *Single band gray* or *Single band pseudocolor*
1. Click Classify to see the result of the default settings
2. Experiment with the settings e.g. `Interpolation`, `Color ramp` and `Mode` until you're happy with the result



### Adjust layer transparency

It can be useful to make layers partially **transparent**, particularly if you want to reduce the visual impact of thematic raster layers, or allow layers such as a hillshade/terrain to be faintly visible without dominating your map

For **vector** layers :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

> 1. On the `Symbology` tab, click on the triangle beside `Layer rendering` to expand that section
1. Adjust the `Opacity` to below 100% (e.g. 60%) and click `Apply` to see the result

<br>

For **raster** layers :black_square_button:

> 1. Switch to the `Transparency` tab
2. Adjust `Global opacity` to below 100% (e.g. 60%) and click `Apply` to see the result
