## Module 4 assignment

Your final assignment for this course!  It's a little different from the previous ones, as you'll submit your final map instead of a screenshot.  This assignment includes the usual three parts:
1. **Evidence** :information_source: - A screenshot of QGIS showing your progress
2. **Reflection** :thought_balloon: - A paragraph describing your experience of the learning activities on this module
3. **Peer feedback** :speech_balloon: - A comment on someone else's assignment

### Prepare your assignment

1. Save your final **QGIS map** as an image file - *this is your Evidence* :information_source:  You can use your own field data, or choose whichever of the gibbon case study datasets you wish to show
2. Write a paragraph stating the **message** of your assignment map, and briefly describing how this module's activities have contributed to progress towards your learning goal - *this is your Reflection* for this week :thought_balloon:

### Submit your assignment
To submit your assignment, reply to the *Module 4 assignment: Making maps* topic in our community forum - see below

### Offer feedback to peers
Reply to one or more of the other learners' assignments - *this is your Peer feedback* :speech_balloon:  Your reply should include three elements:
1. **Positive feedback**: What have they done well?
2. **Suggestion or question**: A suggestion for improvement or extending what they've done, or a question if there's something they need to clarify
3. **Reflection**: What you've learned from their work that you can apply to your own?
