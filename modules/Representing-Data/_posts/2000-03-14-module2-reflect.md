Congratulations!  You've learned about the two main models for representing geospatial data, raster and vector, and considered the sources and effects of uncertainty in your GIS work :thinking:

## Reflect on your progress

Take a few minutes to **reflect** on what you've learned this week
1. What is the *most useful* thing you've learned so far?
2. What is your biggest *remaining question* at this point?
