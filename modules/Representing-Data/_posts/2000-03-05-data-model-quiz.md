## Spatial data models
### Quiz: Spatial data models

### Ambiguity

The invention of remote-sensing, from photography to radar and satellite imagery, has caused an explosion in our ability to record data continuously across a landscape.  However, we often still collect samples at point locations, for example rainfall at weather stations, or vegetation height in isolated quadrats.  This means that some variables are a spatial continuum, but they may be represented in vector format, for example topographic contour lines to represent a DEM


*[vector]: Discrete points, lines or polygons
*[raster]: Continuous grid or image
