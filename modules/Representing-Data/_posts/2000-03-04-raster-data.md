## Raster data model

The raster data model is best for modeling properties which **vary continuously** across the landscape, and can be measured at any location

Examples of raster features from field surveys or remote sensing:
- Soil type or vegetation class :evergreen_tree: :deciduous_tree:
- Elevation :mountain:
- Plant density :ear_of_rice:
- Ice depth :snowflake:
- Vegetation productivity :seedling: :fallen_leaf:
- Suitability or risk :radioactive:

A raster dataset is composed of a **uniform grid** of identically-sized cells (usually square), with each cell (or pixel) holding a single numeric value

Raster attributes
: Raster attributes are about the variable at that location, stored as a cell value.  Each grid cell can only store a single value, so if multiple attributes need to be stored (e.g. elevation *and* slope), multiple rasters are needed, which are sometimes bound together in a raster stack

Rasters values can be:
- **Quantities** - *continuous* variables such as rainfall or density.  The DEM we'll use below is an example of a continuous raster
- **Thematic** - *categories* such as vegetation class, presence/absence of a species, represented by a numerical code

Our LandCover dataset is an example of a thematic raster - each pixel contains a code indicating the landcover class at that location.  These are the classes that occur in and around Che Tao Nature Reserve:[^1] 

Code &nbsp; | &nbsp; Landcover class
---:|---
20 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Shrubs
30 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Herbaceous vegetation
40 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Cropland
50 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Urban
80 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Permanent water bodies
90 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Herbaceous wetland
111 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Closed forest, evergreen needle leaf
112 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Closed forest, evergreen broad leaf
114 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Closed forest, deciduous broad leaf
116 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Closed forest, unknown
122 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Open forest, evergreen broad leaf
126 &nbsp; | &nbsp; Open forest, unknown
