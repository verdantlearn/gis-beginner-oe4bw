## Vector data model

The vector data model is best for modeling **discrete objects** which have clearly defined boundaries and can be counted

Examples of vector features:
- Coral reefs :tropical_fish:
- Point sources of pollution :factory:
- Individual trees or patches of wetland :evergreen_tree:
- Animal movement tracks from GPS collars :paw_prints:
- Areas affected by fire or clear-felling :fire:


Vector data come in three spatial forms: **point, line and polygon**.  Each vector feature can have multiple attributes

Points
: One-dimensional feature with a single x and y coordinate (vertex)
This example contains 3 points

Lines
: Linear two dimensional feature composed of a series of x and y coordinates (vertices)

This example contains a single line made from 4 vertices

Polygons
: Two dimensional feature composed of sequence of x and y coordinates (vertices) where the first and last vertex are identical, creating a closed area  

This example contains a single polygon made from 9 vertices

Vector attributes
: Information about a feature or record, stored in columns in the attributes table

### Adjust vector symbology

Let's work with a vector layer in QGIS, and adjust the way the gibbon distribution polygons are displayed

> 1. Double-click on *NomascusConcolor_Distribution* in the `Layers panel` to open the Layer Properties pop-up window
1. Select `Symbology` from the left-hand menu
2. At the top, under where it says 'Fill', click on `Simple Fill`
3. Click on the `Symbol layer type` dropdown just below and select `Outline: Simple Line`
4. Click `Apply` to see the effect - your polygons should now be drawn as an outline only, with no fill colour
5. Adjust the `Color`, `Stroke width` and `Stroke style` to see the effect of these settings

*[feature]: A record - a single point, line or polygon
*[vertex]: x,y coordinates of the point where two lines meet
*[vertices]: Plural of vertex
*[attribute]: Property of a vector feature, or value in a raster cell
*[attributes]: Properties of a vector feature, or value in a raster cell
