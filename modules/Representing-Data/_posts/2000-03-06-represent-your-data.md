## Representing your field data

What kind of geospatial data do **you** collect in the field?  What do you think is the appropriate geospatial data model for your own data: vector or raster?  If vector, are your layers points, lines or polygons?  If raster, are they thematic or continuous?

Is it an easy or a difficult decision?  Is there any ambiguity about which data model you should use?

Share your examples of vector and raster datasets in the discussion topic below, plus any questions you may have
